      <p>
        I’m a swiss-italian 43 years old woman based in Zürich. I love
        everything that has to do with Visual Communication, Art, Film and I
        feel a true devotion for social engagement.  I love working with people,
        specially if they have the same passion and values I have for what they
        do.

      <header><h1>Looking for an opportunity to provide a change</h1></header>

      <p>I want to make a difference. And I can make a difference.</p>
      <p>
        I have worked as a graphic designer for various brands and agencies in
        print media, packaging design, development and corporate design. That’s
        good and exciting. But I am looking for more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to grow, develop in a team, get the best out of myself -
        make a difference. With more than 15 years of professional experience in
        a wide range of activities, I want to bring the whole range of skills to
        my work. As a visual designer, communication strategist, social worker
        and multilingual person I aim to work for projects that have a meaning,
        a purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you interested in working together? I would love to hear from you.
